    <h1><a href = "index.html">About Me</a></h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Micah, a BSIT student from PUP Santa Maria Campus. I love and enjoy coding. It helps me to challenge myself beyond my limits. Reading and writing were my hobbies. I also
        like taking pictures like sunsets, clouds, trees, and busy streets. I'd like to be a front-end developer someday of time permits. Designing creative works were one of my strengths which
        embody in every school outputs that I had. Milktea and coffee were my two favorite drinks.
